                                <li>I first started coding when I learned Java in 8th grade; since then, I've created numerous projects both in and outside of class.</li>
                                <li>I coded almost entirely in Java from 8th grade until 10th, when I learned Python as part of AT CS. Nowadays, I code mainly in Mathematica, a functional programming language designed to assist in mathematical tasks. Over the years, I've created projects in all of these languages, although most of my projects are still in Java.</li>
                                <li>Many of my projects have been created for class, but I have also coded some for fun, sometimes as an extension of a class project. I have also coded in order to aid in other tasks, such as processing large amounts of data, or exploring a mathematical problem.</li>
